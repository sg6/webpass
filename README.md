# WebPassSec
WebPassSec will be a web-based password manager for teams which can be hosted on your own server.
The aim is to host a big amount of passwords within one place, encrypted with the newest and most secure standards and easy to share with your colleagues, clients, team members and other people.

The password manager will be built with JavaScript and TypeScript, with NestJS in the backend and Angular in the frontend.

This project is still w-i-p, so be patient and stay tuned :)
